\f[B]Notice: When mouting a directory from the host into the container,
ensure that the mounted directory has the appropriate permissions and
that the owner and group of the directory matches the user UID or name
which is running inside the container.\f[]
.SS Usage
.PP
For this, we will assume that you are using the
\f[C]rhscl/redis\-32\-rhel7\f[] image.
If you want to set only the mandatory environment variables and not
store the database in a host directory, execute the following command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ docker\ run\ \-d\ \-\-name\ redis_database\ \-p\ 6379:6379\ rhscl/redis\-32\-rhel7
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This will create a container named \f[C]redis_database\f[].
Port 6379 will be exposed and mapped to the host.
.PP
If you want your database to be persistent across container executions,
also add a \f[C]\-v\ /host/db/path:/var/lib/redis/data:Z\f[] argument.
This will be the Redis data directory.
.PP
For protecting Redis data by a password, pass \f[C]REDIS_PASSWORD\f[]
environment variable to the container like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ docker\ run\ \-d\ \-\-name\ redis_database\ \-e\ REDIS_PASSWORD=strongpassword\ rhscl/redis\-32\-rhel7
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]Warning: since Redis is pretty fast an outside user can try up to
150k passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should
use a very strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.\f[]
